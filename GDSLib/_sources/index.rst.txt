Welcome to GDSLib_gdstk's documentation!
========================================

Gdstk (GDSII Tool Kit) is a C++ library for creation and manipulation of GDSII
and OASIS files.  It is also available as a Python module meant to be a
successor to `Gdspy <https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy>`_.

Key features for the creation of complex CAD layouts are included:

* Boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) based on clipping
  algorithm

* Polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling of polygons)

* Efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets

Typical applications of Gdstk are in the fields of electronic chip design,
planar lightwave circuit design, and mechanical engineering.

For installation instructions and other information, please check out the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/heitzmann/gdstk>`_ or the README file
included with the source.
